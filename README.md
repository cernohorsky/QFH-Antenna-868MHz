## Quadrifilar Helix Antenna for 868 MHz
Quadrifilar Helix Antenna is omnidirectional circularly polarized antenna. It's ability to receive or transmit a tight beam of
circularly polarized radiation while minimizing unwanted radiation perfect fits especially for satellite communication. This 3D model helps to achieve correct shape of antenna segments which has crucial effect for correct circular polarization.

<b>Warning. 3D model add parasitic capacity to antenna which moves resonant frequency. This was corrected by calculating antenna for higher frequeny (913 MHz). Changing any parameter must be verified by measurement.</b>
